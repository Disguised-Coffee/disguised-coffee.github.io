                <h3>A quick few words</h3>
                <p>
                    Although it may sound cliche and over said at points of time, I thank my teachers and parents for pushing, motivating, and teaching me. They are the ones who sacrifice themselves and their desires to put up with a test of patience and mental will. Without them, I wouldn't have been able to be where I am today nor would I have ever gotten into computer science. Without them, I wouldn't have known of the multiple paths I could take and the ones I should avoid. Without them, I wouldn't have even known what 9 + 10 is or my left from my right.<br>
                    My life would have been much harder without any of them.<br><br>
                    So then, I assume that the least I can say is thanks ma, thanks pa.<br><br>
                    Thank you to the many teachers I've had and the teachers I will have.<br><br>
