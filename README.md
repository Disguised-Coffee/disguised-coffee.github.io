**Personal website, redesigned in React!** <br>
*(updating plain text was boring and tedious)*<br>

Originally started as a highschool project and revitalized by Code Nation, the site has had multiple iterations with a major transition from static HTML to ReactJS. ReactJS is used as information on the page can be easily updated by updating a JSON file rather than manipulating HTML by itself. A Google Sheet to JSON setup is planned and is yet to be fully implemented.
